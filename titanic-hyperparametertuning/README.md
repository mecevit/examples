# Titanic Survival Example with Hyper Parameter Tuning

This is an example project which focuses development of an ml model to predict the survivals of the passenger in the Titanic disaster. This model will use the features extracted from the popular [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

What you are going to learn:
- Layer Feature Store: Creating and consuming features
- Hyper parameter tuning
- Model Training in Layer
---

To run it, first install Layer SDK:

```
pip install layer-sdk
```

Login to Layer:

```
layer login
```

Init Layer in this directory:

```
layer init
```

And, now you are ready to run the project:

```
$ layer run

Layer v0.18.1
